have the master output rmkx/rmcup on MSG_DETACH if needed
- problem: client needs to be the one to close connection, because MSG_DETACH
  and MSG_ATTACH are also used when suspending, so the master must leave the
  connection open
- so there needs to be some way to tell or guess when the master is done
  sending (or doesn't need to send) the rmkx/rmcup strings, e.g. change to the
  protocol :(
